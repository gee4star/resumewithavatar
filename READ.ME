This website is a mock restaurat that specializes in varieties of pizza and fresh fruit juices and smoothies. The four pages include a  resume, homepage, a menu page and a catering page. On the menu page there is a introduction of the services the restaurant offers, such as their menu items, their delivery services and their catering services. I was able to use background images, and background no-repeat because the first issue I had was the background image was repeating all over the page. Also, I implemented the :hover attribute for 3 images with one rotating 360 degrees, one sliding 100px and one rotating 60 degrees. 
If I had more time, I would implement additional css tricks one of whch includes a hover method where a picture breaks into small pixels when you hover over it.  
A few resources I used include: w3schools.com, geekforgeeks.com, giphy.com.  
Q: What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier? 
I would have spent more time on the wireframe development but I wanted to spend time getting this finished by the due date. 
Q:Were there any requirements that were difficult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?
Yes, getting the gif to open and show up on my page was extremely difficult. I , used various recources and youtube videos.
